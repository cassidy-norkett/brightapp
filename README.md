## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the Bright App up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- **Flutter SDK:** Make sure you have [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) installed.
- **Firebase Account:** Set up a [Firebase project](https://firebase.google.com/) to enable authentication.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Set Up Firebase**

   - Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Create a new project and add an Android and iOS app.
   - Download the `google-services.json` file for Android and place it in the `android/app` directory.
   - Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file for iOS and place it in the `ios/Runner` directory.
   - Update the Firebase configuration in `main.dart` to match your project.

4. **Run the App**

   Ensure you have a connected device or emulator.

## 🔧 Configuration

Make sure to update the following configurations as needed:

- **Firebase Authentication Providers:** Enable **Email/Password** as the sign-in method in the Firebase Console.
- **Android Manifest and iOS Plist Files:** Ensure Firebase is configured correctly in your app’s native files.
